# PowerTech Clang
>We care about Developers, so we create Simple, Powerful and Convenient tools for them. This Compiler fork is intended for C/C++ Developers. We believe that the most functional, modern and promising compiler today is Clang (LLVM project), so we built our tools relative to the Clang/LLVM infrastructure.

*Please note that the compiler is under active development, we will update this article as new functionality becomes available. We will be glad for your participation in the development, testing and voicing of proposals. Feel free in [Issues](https://github.com/powertech-center/clang/issues), [Discussions](https://github.com/powertech-center/clang/discussions) or in the telegram group [PowerTech C/C++ Beta](https://t.me/powercpp_beta).*

### Install
Now you can freely download the **Beta** version of the compiler, unzip the archive corresponding to your operating system and use it. If you want to add your folder to the `PATH` environment variable or create the necessary symlinks, you can easily find the necessary information on the Internet.

### IDE
Our fork can be freely used in all IDEs that work with standard Clang, such as CLion, Eclipse or VSCode. But we recommend using our Extensions for VSCode: [PowerTech C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PowerTech.powercpp) and [PowerTech Themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PowerTech.powerthemes). It's fast, free and convenient! In the extension settings, you can explicitly specify the path to the compiler.
